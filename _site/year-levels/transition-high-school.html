        <h2>Understanding the High School Transition</h2>
        <p>
          The move from primary to secondary school (typically at the end of Year 6) represents one of the biggest changes in a child's educational journey. Students leave the familiar environment of primary school—often with the same teacher and classmates for years—and enter a much larger school with multiple teachers, changing classrooms, and increased independence requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          This transition occurs during early adolescence, a time of significant physical, emotional, and social changes. The combination of developmental changes and school transition can feel overwhelming for many students. However, with appropriate preparation and support, most children adapt successfully and thrive in their new environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parents play a crucial role in this transition, providing emotional support, practical preparation, and ongoing encouragement. Understanding what to expect helps families support their child through this important milestone.

        <p>
          The transition to high school sets the foundation for secondary education success. Children who navigate this transition well develop confidence, independence, and essential life skills that serve them throughout their educational journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the first few weeks or months may be challenging, most students adapt successfully with appropriate support. Focus on your child's overall wellbeing rather than just academic performance. Celebrate small victories and provide consistent encouragement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that every child transitions at their own pace. Some adjust quickly, while others take longer. With patience, support, and professional guidance when needed, your child will successfully navigate this important milestone.
