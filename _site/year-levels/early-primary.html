        <h2>The Transition to Primary School</h2>
        <p>
          Starting primary school marks a significant milestone in your child's development. The early primary years (Prep to Year 2) are a time of rapid growth in social skills, emotional regulation, and foundational academic abilities. Children typically enter Prep at age 5 and progress through Year 1 and Year 2, building essential skills for future learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          This period focuses on creating positive attitudes toward learning, developing basic literacy and numeracy skills, and helping children form healthy relationships with peers and teachers. Every child develops at their own pace, and schools provide differentiated support to meet individual needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parents play a crucial role during this transition, providing emotional support, establishing routines, and maintaining open communication with teachers. The early primary years set the foundation for lifelong learning habits and self-confidence.

        <h2>Assessment and Progress Monitoring</h2>
        <h3>School Assessments</h3>
        <p>
          Early primary uses informal and formal assessments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ongoing observations:</strong> Teachers watch learning in action</li>
          <li><strong>Work samples:</strong> Collections of student work</li>

        <h2>Preparing for the Next Stage</h2>
        <p>
          By the end of Year 2, children should be ready for the increased demands of middle primary. Signs of readiness include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Academic skills:</strong> Fluent reading, basic writing, number operations</li>
          <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Managing school routines with minimal support</li>
          <li><strong>Social maturity:</strong> Working cooperatively, resolving conflicts</li>
          <li><strong>Learning habits:</strong> Following directions, completing tasks</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If your child needs additional support to reach these milestones, discuss options with their teacher. Many schools offer transition programs and additional assistance to ensure all children are ready for Year 3.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Remember: Every Child is Unique</h2>
        <p>
          While developmental milestones provide useful guides, every child develops at their own pace. Some children may excel in certain areas while needing more time in others. The key is providing a supportive environment where children feel safe to learn and grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Celebrate your child's individual progress and strengths. Focus on their effort, curiosity, and love of learning rather than comparing them to others. With consistent support from home and school, children in the early primary years build strong foundations for future academic and personal success.
