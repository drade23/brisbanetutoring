        <h2>Understanding Middle Primary Development</h2>
        <p>
          Years 3-6 (typically ages 8-11) represent a crucial transition period in your child's education. Children move from "learning to read and write" to "reading and writing to learn." This phase builds on early primary foundations while introducing more complex concepts and greater independence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Middle primary students develop abstract thinking, improved concentration, and the ability to work more independently. They begin understanding different perspectives, managing time better, and taking responsibility for their learning. Socially, friendships become more complex, and children learn to navigate peer relationships and group dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parents play a vital role during this period by providing support, encouragement, and resources while gradually encouraging independence. The middle primary years set the stage for successful secondary education and lifelong learning habits.

        <h2>Balancing Support and Independence</h2>
