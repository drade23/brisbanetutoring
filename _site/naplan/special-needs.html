        <h2>Understanding Inclusive Assessment</h2>
        <p>
          NAPLAN is designed to be inclusive, ensuring all students can participate regardless of disability or learning needs. The program provides reasonable adjustments to remove barriers while maintaining the integrity of the assessment. This means students with additional needs can demonstrate their true abilities without being disadvantaged by their condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Queensland education authorities work with schools to implement the Disability Discrimination Act and Disability Standards for Education, ensuring equitable access to NAPLAN. The focus is on assessing what students know and can do, not on their disability or learning difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many parents worry that accommodations might give an unfair advantage, but research shows that appropriate adjustments simply level the playing field. Students receive the support they need to show their actual capabilities, not artificial boosts.
        </p>

        <h2>Planning for Future Tests</h2>
        <p>
          NAPLAN occurs every three years for most students. Families should:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Review accommodations:</strong> Assess effectiveness and make adjustments</li>
          <li><strong>Update documentation:</strong> Ensure reports remain current</li>
          <li><strong>Build familiarity:</strong> Practice with similar formats and supports</li>
          <li><strong>Advocate consistently:</strong> Maintain communication with schools</li>
          <li><strong>Track progress:</strong> Monitor development and accommodation needs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The goal of accommodations is to ensure every student can participate meaningfully in NAPLAN, demonstrating their true capabilities. With appropriate support, students with additional needs can show what they know and can do, contributing to a more complete picture of their educational progress.
