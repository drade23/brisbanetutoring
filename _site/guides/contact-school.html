        <h2>Why Early Communication Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Most learning difficulties can be addressed more effectively when identified and addressed early. Waiting too long can allow small issues to become bigger challenges. Schools appreciate proactive parents who communicate concerns early, as it allows them to provide timely support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that teachers want your child to succeed and have valuable insights into their learning. Open communication creates a partnership that benefits everyone involved.
