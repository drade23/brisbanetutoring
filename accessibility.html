      <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>
      <p class="intro">The North Brisbane &amp; Moreton Bay Education Guide is committed to making its content as accessible and usable as possible for all parents and carers, including people with disabilities.
      We aim to provide clear, inclusive information that can be accessed across a range of devices, assistive technologies, and browsing preferences.</p>

      <h2>Our approach to accessibility</h2>
      <p>This site is designed and maintained with accessibility in mind. In particular, we aim to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use clear, structured content with logical headings</li>
        <li>Rely on semantic HTML to support screen readers and assistive technologies</li>
        <li>Ensure text remains readable at different screen sizes and zoom levels</li>
        <li>Support keyboard navigation wherever possible</li>
        <li>Avoid unnecessary animations, pop-ups, or complex interactions</li>
        <li>Keep JavaScript use to a minimum, limited to essential search functionality</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where possible, we aim to align with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.</p>

      <h2>Known limitations</h2>
      <p>As this is a growing educational resource, some content may not yet meet all accessibility best practices. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some older pages or images may not include full text alternatives</li>
        <li>Third-party content or links may not always meet the same accessibility standards</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We prioritise improvements where issues are identified and aim to address barriers as resources allow.</p>
