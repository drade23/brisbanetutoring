        <h2>The Senior Years Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Years 11-12 (typically ages 16-17) represent the culmination of secondary education, focusing on specialization, independent learning, and preparation for post-school pathways. Students move toward greater autonomy while facing increased academic demands and important life decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This period involves balancing academic achievement with personal growth, career exploration, and the transition to adulthood. Students develop advanced study skills, make subject choices that impact future opportunities, and begin planning their post-school lives. The senior years require strong organizational skills, resilience, and the ability to manage competing priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parents play a crucial supporting role, providing guidance while allowing growing independence. Understanding the senior years landscape helps families navigate this significant transition successfully.
