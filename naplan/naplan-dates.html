        <h2>NAPLAN Testing Schedule</h2>
        <p>
          NAPLAN (National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy) is Australia's largest educational assessment program. It provides a snapshot of student achievement in literacy and numeracy at key points in their schooling. Understanding when NAPLAN occurs helps families prepare appropriately and reduces anxiety around testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          NAPLAN is held annually in May across all Australian states and territories. While exact dates can vary slightly from year to year, the testing window is consistent, allowing schools and families to plan ahead.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Annual Testing Timeline</h2>
        <h3>Typical NAPLAN Schedule</h3>
        <p>
          NAPLAN testing occurs during a two-week window in May, usually spanning Tuesday to Thursday of the second week of the month. The tests are administered on the same days nationally to ensure fairness.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Test Window:</strong> Second week of May (typically the week containing Mother's Day)</li>
          <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Three consecutive school days</li>
          <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Morning sessions, usually starting between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM</li>
          <li><strong>National Coordination:</strong> All states and territories test simultaneously</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Year-to-Year Variations</h3>
        <p>
          While the month remains consistent, exact dates can shift slightly:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Calendar alignment:</strong> Tests avoid public holidays and school events</li>
          <li><strong>Weather considerations:</strong> Queensland schools may adjust for extreme weather</li>
          <li><strong>School holidays:</strong> Never scheduled during term breaks</li>
          <li><strong>Religious observances:</strong> Accommodations made for significant dates</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Test Structure and Timing</h2>
        <h3>Three-Day Format</h3>
        <p>
          NAPLAN is spread across three consecutive days to reduce student fatigue and allow thorough assessment of different skills:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Language Conventions and Numeracy</li>
          <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> Reading</li>
          <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Writing</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Session Lengths</h3>
        <p>
          Each test session is designed to fit within a normal school morning:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Language Conventions:</strong> 40 minutes</li>
          <li><strong>Numeracy:</strong> 50 minutes</li>
          <li><strong>Reading:</strong> 50 minutes</li>
          <li><strong>Writing:</strong> 40 minutes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Break and Timing</h3>
        <p>
          Schools build in breaks and transitions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Start time:</strong> Usually 9:00–9:30 AM to align with school routines</li>
          <li><strong>Breaks:</strong> Short breaks between components on multi-part days</li>
          <li><strong>Completion:</strong> Tests finish by 11:00–11:30 AM</li>
          <li><strong>Normal day:</strong> Students return to regular classes after testing</li>

      <section>
        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          NAPLAN occurs annually, so families can anticipate the schedule each year. Students in tested year levels will participate every three years (Year 3, then Year 5, then Year 7, then Year 9). This regular assessment helps track progress over time and informs teaching approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding the NAPLAN schedule helps families plan effectively and approach testing with confidence. The tests are just one measure of student achievement, and schools use the results to support ongoing learning and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that NAPLAN is designed to assess what students know and can do, not to create stress or competition. With appropriate preparation and support, students can approach the tests positively and perform to the best of their abilities.
